# What is System-D?

System-D is a platform that allows you to organize and manage projects with several people, through an innovative, simple and user-friendly interface.

The data stored on the platform are systematically encrypted and therefore accessible only to the members of each project.

No need to give your email address or mobile phone number to register, just a nickname is enough!

System-D is available in the languages below:

- French,
- English,
- Spanish,
- German,
- Italian.

![Main Screen](/images/SD_MainScreen.png)

# Who's System-D for?

System-D is aimed at any group of people gathered around projects such as :

- associative projects,

- educational projects,

- personal projects,

- projects linked to "events" such as the organization of a flea market in his village, or the organization of a public meeting, etc...

- .../...

# Can I trust this free platform?

Like any Free solution, it is its users who will be responsible for the sustainability of the platform like many other similar projects (example : [Wikipedia](https://fr.wikipedia.org)) in the form of [one-off or recurring donations](https://www.system-d.org/donate), allowing the necessary infrastructure to be financed.

# How to register?

Simply go to https://www.system-d.org, click on **Registration** and follow the steps to create your account. Please note that no personal data will be requested.

# What are the features of System-D?

It all starts with the creation of a project. It is usually the "leader of the pack" (called Administrator in System-D) who will take the initiative to create a new project. 

Once the project is created, he will simply invite the members he wants by giving them (by whatever means he wishes) a URL (a specific Internet address) that corresponds to an invitation to participate in the project.

Depending on the size and criticality of the project, the Administrator is advised to appoint an "assistant" who will also take on the role of Administrator, it is wiser .

To each project will be associated :

- a forum,

- a tasks manager,

- an agenda,

- a world map, to position tasks if necessary or, more simply, points of interest (markers) related to the project,

- a membership directory,

- project-specific parameters,

- a notification system.

**Warning, all members have access to all the resources of a project. Remember that System-D is based on sharing and collaboration above all!**

## The Forum

It is a little bit the project's homepage which will gather the main resources of the project, that is to say :

- The Main Discussion,

- The Documents,

- The Tables,

- The "secondary" folders.

### The Main Topic

This is where we talk, discuss and palaver about a project using three types of publications:

![The Toolbar](/images/SD_ToolbarPost.png)

- (1) "Text" type publication, which, as its name suggests, allows you to simply post text, with or without smileys and within the limit of 10,000 characters,

- (2) "Files" type publication, which allows to store (send) on the platform, all types of files (except **Fix me** files) related to the project such as PDF documents, images, text files, within the limit of 500MB per project and **Fix me** MB per file,

- (3) "Poll" type publication, which makes it very easy to question project members on the decisions to be taken around the project or simply to collect their opinions.

![Poll](/images/SD_Poll.png)

### Files

This is where all the documents that have been posted via the Main Discussion will be grouped together. The documents are therefore available to all members (for viewing through the browser depending on the type of file or as a simple download). A gauge allows you to appreciate the filling rate of your storage space which, let's remember, is limited.

![Files](/images/SD_Files.png)

**Attention** The only way to store files for the project is to post a file via the **Main Discussion**

### The Spreadsheets

System-D is equipped with a mini spreadsheet, although with limited functionality, it is more than sufficient for the most common needs such as :

- a directory of contact,

- a shopping list,

- a repository of products or tools,

- .../...

NB: For optimal use, it is advisable to limit the number of lines to 2500, which is already quite a lot!

![The Spreadsheet](/images/SD_AniTableur.gif)


#### Tools

![The Table toolbar](/images/SD_ToolbarSheet.png)

(1) Delete the table
(2) Rename the table
(3) Importing a CSV file
(4) Search for words/values in the table (acts as a filter)

![The Spreadsheet Toolbar](/images/SD_ToolbarCalc.png)

(1) Cancel last action
(2) Repeat the last action
(3) Export the table in CSV format
(4) Change the font size
(5) Font colour
(6) Cell background color
(7) Align to the left
(8) Center 
(9) Align to the right
(10) Bold
(11) Italics
(12) Switching the spreadsheet to full screen (Esc to exit)

#### Importing data into a sheet from a CSV file type

If you already have data in a spreadsheet program on your PC then you can import them directly into the System-D spreadsheet program:

- from your spreadsheet (MS Excel, LibreOffice Calc, ...) export your sheet in CSV format,
- on System-D, open your table, go to the table settings and click on the import button (as shown below)

NB: Files to be imported must have the .csv extension and the comma or semicolon is accepted as field separator (columns).

**Caution**: each new data import overwrites all existing data in the destination table.

#### Export data from a table to a CSV file type

Right-click on a table to display a context menu. This menu contains, among other things, the functionality to export your sheet to a CSV file.

#### Filter, search for data in a table

The search button allows you to filter the table entries that contain the text (or value) you are looking for.

#### The basic formulas

It is a spreadsheet with very "simple" functions and uses a syntax (for formulas) equivalent to those of the spreadsheets on the market.

The main restrictions and rules of use of this simplified spreadsheet are :

- few formulas or functions from MS Excel or LibreOffice Calc are available.
- copy/paste only copies values, not formulas.
- the formulas are to be expressed in UPPERCASE only and in their English version, for example: =SUM(A1:A5) which adds the contents of the cells from A1 to A5
- The cell (or argument) separator in a formula is the comma (,)
- the separator of a series of cells are the two superimposed points (:)
- the separator of decimals is the point (.)

Below are some of the most useful formulas that have been tested:

- **=A1+A2** which returns the result of the addition of the values contained in A1 and A2
- **=A1*A2** which returns the result of the multiplication of the values contained in A1 and A2
- **=A1-A2** which returns the result of subtracting A2 from A1
- **=A1/A2** which returns the result of dividing A1 by A2
- **=SUM(A1:A5)** which returns the sum of the values in cells A1 to A5
- **=AVERAGE(A1:A5)** which returns the average of the values in cells A1 to A5
- **=MIN(A1:A5)** which returns the smallest of the values in cells A1 to A5.
- **=MAX(A1:A5)** which returns the largest value among the values in cells A1 to A5.
- **=PI()** which returns the value of IP
- **=A1>B1** which renounces TRUE if A1 is strictly superior to B1, otherwise it returns FALSE.
- **=A1<B1** which renounces TRUE if A1 is strictly inferior to B1, otherwise it returns FALSE.
- **=ROUND(A1,2)** which returns 12.05 if A1 contains 12.048545
- **=IF(B1>60, "OK", "NOK")** which returns the text "OK" if B1 is strictly greater than 60 otherwise returns the text "NOK".
- **=COUNT(A1:B10)** which returns the number of cells, contained in the series A1:B10, that contain a value of
- **=CONCATENATE(A1," & ",B1)** which returns the text "Tom & Jerry" if A1 and B1 contain "Tom" and "Jerry" respectively.
- **=RAND()** which returns a random number between 0 and 1

### The "secondary" folders

Within each project, you have the possibility to create "secondary" folders by simply clicking on **New Folder**.

These secondary folders only allow you to create a "secondary" **Discussion** (compared to the main discussion) which can be very practical for large projects where only part of the group can be assigned to a particular topic and in order not to "pollute" the Main Discussion.

Note that a "secondary" folder can contain several discussions.

## The Tasks

A task is simply a "thing" to be carried out, alone or with several people, in a defined or undefined timing, in a defined or undefined place, and all these tasks allow the project to be carried out in its entirety.

![](/images/SD_Task.png)

This is the approach of System-D and this is how the task management screen is organized, in 4 columns:

- the column "**To do**" contains the tasks which have no timing and which are not finished,

- the column "**Set on calendar**" contains tasks that have an end date, implying that the task must be completed by that date or, at the latest, by that date,

- the column "**Waiting validation**" contains tasks with an end date that has passed, implying those that are overdue. Note that this column is filled "automatically" according to the current date and the due date of the task,

- the column "**Done**" contains of course the tasks that you will consider as completed because, as you have well understood, it is up to you to place the tasks in this column! 

![TasksList](/images/SD_TasksList.png)

### Create a task

Go to the list of tasks and click on **New task**, a window appears on the right side of the screen and it allows :

- to give a name to this task,
- to give details of the task to be performed, but it is not mandatory,
- to give it a color,
- to associate a checklist to it, but it is not mandatory,
- invite other project members to join in this task, implying that they have a role to play in this task,
- to position a task on a map (e.g. if a task consists of an event at an agreed location) but again this is not an obligation.

Note that at this stage the task does not have an end date, see next paragraph.

### Placing a task on the Calendar

In order to give an end date to a task, simply move it to the column **Set on calendar**. This action sends you back to the calendar to place your task.

Please note that a task, whose end date has passed, will automatically be placed in the column **Waiting validation**.

### Completion of a task

Simply move the task to the **Done** column.

### Purge Completed Tasks

If you want to purge the **Done** column, go to the tasks settings with the button below!

![Param](/images/SD_Settings.png)

### Tasks List Settings

By going to the task list settings, you can access :

- the possibility to assign a legend to each color,
- the possibility to purge completed tasks (see previous paragraph).

![Param](/images/SD_Settings.png)

## The Agenda

The Calendar displays the tasks that have been scheduled. Three view modes are available:

- per month,
- per week,
- on a list.

![](/images/SD_Calendar.png)

From the **Agenda** screen, you can directly add a task by clicking on the button below!

![](/images/SD_PlusSign.png)

### Calendar Settings

![](/images/SD_Settings.png)

The button above allows you to access the settings of the task list :
- possibility to set the default view mode (month, week, list),
- possibility to assign a legend to each color,
- ability to purge completed tasks.


## The Map

The map is provided by the OpenStreetMap project [OpenStreetMap](https://www.openstreetmap.org), it displays all tasks that have been geolocated.

![](/images/SD_Map1.png)

From the **Map** screen, you can also add a point of interest (a marker) by clicking on the button below.

![](/images/SD_PlusSign.png)

![](/images/SD_Map2.png)

### Map Settings

![](/images/SD_Settings.png)

This button is used to access the map settings:
- possibility to set the default view mode (Standard, Topographic, Aerial),
- possibility to assign a legend to each color,
- ability to set the location and zoom level when opening the map,
- ability to purge completed tasks.

## Members

A member is a System-D user who has been invited to participate in a project by the project administrator.

![](/images/SD_Settings.png)

This button allows the project administrator to access the member properties and perform the following actions:
- give "Administrator" type rights to a member who is not an administrator,
- remove a member from the project.

### How do I add (or remove) a member to a project?

Whether it's a person who already has an account on System-D (via other projects for example...) or a person who doesn't know System-D at all, the procedure is the same: you have to create an invitation link which is materialized by a rather special URL (unique and secure) and it's this URL (this link) that you'll have to send, by the means of your choice, to the member you want to invite to your project.

**Warning** When you create an invitation link, it is valid by default to invite 5 users and is valid for 1 week. Do not hesitate to reduce these default values if necessary for obvious security reasons.

## Project Settings

By clicking on the icon that symbolizes your project (at the top of the left menu), you can access the project properties with the following possibilities :
- update the avatar (the icon) that symbolizes your project,
- update the description of your project (**Warning**, this is public information)
- view pending invitations,
- generate new invitations,
- delete the project (**Warning**, this action is **irreversible !**)

## The Notification System

Each feature has its own notification system, within the application itself.

Notifications take the form of red LEDs positioned in the menu, in front of each feature, as shown below.

![](/images/SD_Notif1.png)
